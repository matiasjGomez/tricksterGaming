# Trickster Gaming - Gamers Republic

## You can choose your game, add it to a cart and checkout, to emulate the experience from a true ecommerce

## I started my proyect by adding first a Context named ItemContext.js, where i fetch the data from Firebase and reuse it in all the components needed.

## Tried to separate the logic of the components from the alctual render, this adds more flexiblity to the site if i need to make specific changes

## Added Routes to my web applications with react-router-dom, and used the useParams hooks to render the specified cateories of the site, as well the id of the items, gettig that from the url.
